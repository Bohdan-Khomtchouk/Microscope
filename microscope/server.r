# MicroScope is an RShiny and JavaScript (D3.js) software program designed to produce dynamic, interactive heatmaps in an Internet browser.
# MicroScope allows you to magnify any portion of a heatmap by a simple click-and-drag feature to zoom in, and click-once feature to zoom out.
# MicroScope is designed with large heatmaps in mind (e.g., gene expression heatmaps with thousands of genes), where individual entries quickly become unreadable as more are added. 
# However, MicroScope allows you to repeatedly zoom in to any sector of the heatmap to investigate a region, cluster, or even a single gene.  
# MicroScope also allows you to hover the mouse pointer over any specific gene to show precise expression level details.

# MicroScope is an ongoing bioinformatics software project fully financially supported by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) 
# through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program. This research was conducted with Government support 
# under and awarded by DoD, Army Research Office (ARO), National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship, 32 CFR 168a.

# Current work is underway to expand Microscope's user-friendly features.
